# Features-matching to tracking object

## Working principle of the features-matching algorithm

When you observe an object, you can recognize it in different contexts and different photos where the object is present. This means that in different images,
different photos of an object some things don't change otherwise you would not be able to recognize it. The goal of the **feature matching** algorithm is to find the aspects,
the pixels of the image which do not change, describe them and compare them with other images which show the same object. The name of these pixels is **keypoints**.


Thereby the **features-matching** algorithms proceed in three steps : the **detection**, the **description** and the **matching** of **keypoints**.
